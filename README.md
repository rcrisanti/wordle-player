## Sources
Currently, the bot uses static text files as its dictionary & to know how frequent letters occur in the English language. Here are the sources of those files:
 1. word database comes from: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/
 2. letter frequency comes from: https://www3.nd.edu/~busiforc/handouts/cryptography/letterfrequencies.html
